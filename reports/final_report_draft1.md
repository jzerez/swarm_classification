# Ant Colony Algorithm Classification
In this project, we set out to recreate and expand upon Ant Miner, the Ant Colony Algorithm (ACA) for data classification originally proposed by Parpinelli et al. Specifically, they propose a method of using an ACA in order to discover rules that best discriminate between different classes present in a dataset based on measurable attributes.

Ant Miner is tested on various datasets from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. The rulesets that are generated by Ant Miner are compared to rulesets generated by the CN2 algorithm, an established algorithm that similarly creates rulesets to classify data. Comparisons are made both in terms of rule complexity (how many terms are needed in a given rule), as well as rule quality (how well do rules actually classify the data). Through this comparison, they were able to show that Ant Miner was able to deliver classification rules that are much simpler than those of the CN2 algorithm while maintaining comparable classification accuracy.

## Background
An Ant Colony Algorithm (ACA) is an agent based that simulates the natural swarming behavior of ants, namely cooperation and adaptation without direct communication. In an ACA, agents are trying to solve a given problem. The candidate solution proposed by an agent corresponds to a specific path. As the agent traverses the path, 'pheromones' are deposited. The amount of pheromone deposited along a path is directly related to the quality of the path, or solution. The amount of pheromones scattered along the landscape of all possible paths influences the paths of subsequent agents. While the construction of each path is ultimately stochastic, paths with high amounts of pheromone are much more likely to be followed by subsequent agents.

In the case for classifying sets of data, a path corresponds to a proposed rule to determine a class of data. In a dataset, there are a set of attributes common across all pieces of data, and across all attributes, there are a set of common possible values that that attribute can be. The various combinations of attributes and corresponding values makes up the landscape of possible moves from which a rule can be constructed. For instance, if we wished to classify breeds of dogs, the dataset might contain attributes such as fur type or fur color. Corresponding values could be *short/medium/long* and *black/brown/white/mixed*, respectively. An example rule generated in this scenario could be: " *If the fur type is long and the fur color is white, then the dog must be a Samoyed* ".

## Implementation Details
In order to use an ACA to effectively classify data, additional steps must be taken. Firstly, a problem dependent heuristic is calculated given the attributes of the pieces of data that need to be classified. This heuristic seeks to quantify the normalized entropy associated with different combination of data attributes and data classifications. In other words, this heuristic identifies attributes values of data that are highly correlated with a specific class. In a classic ACA, the probability of taking a step in a certain direction along a path is proportional to the amount of pheromone in that direction. However, in Ant Miner, the probability of taking a step in a certain direction is proportional to both the problem dependent heuristic function and the pheromones.

Secondly, Ant Miner implements rule pruning, a technique quite common in classification algorithms. After a path is first generated, the agent evaluates how much each part of the solution/path contributes to the overall quality of the solution/path. If any parts of the path are redundant, or harmful to the overall quality of the path, those parts are removed, or pruned, from the path. This process is done iteratively until all path segments directly benefit the quality of the overall path. This step is important as it allows for much faster convergence of rules and allows for the removal of 'unlucky' steps taken by the stochastic model.
