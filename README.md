# swarm_classification
In this project, we set out to recreate and expand upon Ant Miner, the Ant Colony Algorithm (ACA) for data classification originally proposed by Parpinelli et al. Specifically, they propose a method of using an ACA in order to discover rules that best discriminate between different classes present in a dataset based on measurable attributes. See our [final report](https://github.com/jzerez/swarm_classification/blob/master/reports/Final_Report.md) for more details.
